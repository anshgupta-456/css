Portfolio website
Welcome to the final project for the CSS course! ðŸŒ²

It's time to express yourself using everything you learned about HTML and CSS and build your own personal site!

Along your programming journey, you'll find that building and maintaining a personal website is an invaluable tool! These usually include the following:

An "About" section with a short paragraph describing the person who built the portfolio site, that may include a picture of them.
A "Projects" or "Work" section that showcases your awesome projects and includes a link to the source code (and perhaps one for a demo).
A "Contact" section that includes ways for someone to contact that person who built the portfolio site (e.g., forms for email sign-up, links to social media).
While this project will focus on styling with CSS, you will still need HTML. Here is some starter code for an index.html file:

For the CSS, create a styles.css file and make sure to include what we learned throughout this course:

Writing CSS styles, including selectors with declarations.
Using common properties related to color, size, font, text alignment, and background.
Working with a given element's box model by modifying their width/height, border, padding, and margin.
Laying out elements on the page according to how they're displayed and positioned.
